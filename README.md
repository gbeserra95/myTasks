# myTasks

A JavaScript TO-DO list developed by me as part of my studies in [DEVinHouse](https://github.com/gbeserra95/DEVinHouse).

## Project requirements

The application must have:

- a title on the browser tab, so the user can find your application among the various tabs they constantly keep open.

- a header inside the page, so the user can easily know where the page is and what the content is about.

- a text field to enter the name of a new activity to be added to the list.

- a button to add a new activity to the list.

- a list containing the activities already entered.

Each line of the list must contain:

- a checkbox for the user to mark that that activity has already been performed.
- the text that the user typed when registering the activity.
- button to delete the activity from the list, if desired.

When the user marks a task as done, the line text must be strikethrough.

The list must be saved in the browser's "localStorage" (including which items have already been performed), and must be loaded whenever the page reopens.
